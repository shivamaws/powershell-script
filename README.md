⚡ PowerShell – Day-to-Day Automation Scripts

Welcome to my PowerShell automation repository 👋

This repo contains real, practical PowerShell scripts that I use (and have used) for day-to-day operational tasks in enterprise cloud and IT environments. 
These are not lab-only scripts — they are written with production safety, clarity, and reusability in mind.
